In this repo we are collecting responses to misrepresentations of Monero in the media - including information and responses we sent to the media.
[check our issues](https://github.com/riatlabs/monero-response/issues) if you want to see our current status.

You can help by fact-checking online "news" outlets and calling them out if they are misrepresenting information. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/riatlabs/monero-response/issues) if you have found something online.

Please also call them out on X, and on Coinmarketcap. Here are a few good places to start
* Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet "Monero appears to be in the midst of a successful 51% attack" https://x.com/P3b7_/status/1955173413992984988
* Monero was successfully attacked; XMR is now insecure & centralized Qubic can rewrite XMR history, censor & double-spend!" https://x.com/Justin_Bons/status/1958216006071189907
* CMC TLDR: "Qubic executed a 51% attack on Monero, prompting concerns about the robustness of Moneroâ€™s proof-of-work system amidst threats posed by concentrated mining power" https://coinmarketcap.com/community/post/367141825/

Our current focus is the [alleged 51% attack](https://riat.at/qubic-attack-on-xmr-monero-no-51-attack-proven/) on XMR Monero, but we are slowly working our way up to address other misrepresentations and forms of lazy journalism as we go.
