In this repo we are collecting responses to misrepresentations of Monero in the media - including information and responses sent to them.
[Go to the wiki](https://github.com/riatlabs/monero-response/wiki) if you want to see our current status.

You can help by fact-checking online "news" outlets and calling them out if they are misrepresenting information.
Our current focus is the [alleged 51% attack](https://riat.at/qubic-attack-on-xmr-monero-no-51-attack-proven/) on XMR Monero.
